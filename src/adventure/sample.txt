Intro|<para>Now that the radiation has pretty much died out, and people have started building new villages far away from any of the old cities, and the east and west coasts have stopped burning, mostly, your father turns from where he's sitting by the campfire burning some Steinbeck for warmth and says, "Son, civilization will be starting up again soon."</para><para>Your name is Steffan McFessel.  You live in a small, dingy, post-catastrophic village just outside Capitol, center of the fledgling Mid-Nebraskan Conglomerate (Regent Nicholas III presiding).  Your father's tone makes you realize, with no little discomfort, that you, as a sixteen-year-old white mid-American male, are exactly the right demographic for being pushed from the nest and forced to make haphazard choices about your post-apocalyptic future.</para><para>"So, what do you want to do with your life, boy?"  You grimace when he tosses a Hawthorne into the waning flames.  About the only thing you enjoy in life is reading the pre-Last War books you've scrounged from the ruins of North Platte.  Dad likes them, too.  They're great kindling.</para><para>"Dunno," you say, hoping nonchalance will thwart him.  It doesn't work.  Once chalant, your Father can never be nonned out of it.</para><para>"There's a few apprenticeships opening up in Capitol, you know," Dad says, feigning offhandedness.  "In fact, I've set you up some interviews with the Regent's Mentors for Philosophical Counsel, Military Heroism, and Court Jesterdom at three, four, and five o'clock today."</para><para>"Court Jesterdom?" you ask, blinking.</para><para>"Let's not kid ourselves, son.  Not everybody's a hero or a genius."</para><para>And so your forced adventure begins.</para>|Section A¿A hero's adventure, since you fit the demographic.¿Section B¿Philosophical pursuits.  Those books made quite an impact on you.¿Section C¿Comedy-people are probably going to laugh at you anyway.
Section A|<para>You choose to follow the path of Military Heroism.  Three long years of apprenticeship pass.</para><para>Your Mentor, Commander Senecalius of the Conglomerate Militia, is a harsh but fair taskmaster.  You learned that your very first day when he gently asked you, "Tell me, young McFessel: Do you believe essence precedes existence?"  When you answered, "I don't think so," he nodded serenely, draped an avuncular arm about your shoulders, and noogied your skull for fifteen minutes straight while holding you in a headlock.  Then he let you try another answer.</para><para>In the muddy training field of Capitol's western sector, you learn from your Mentor the arcane craft of a Philosopher Warrior-how to use Nietzsche as rationale for slaying unarmed opponents; emotional Kantian fluctuations to keep adversaries off balance; New-Age Platonism to envision the Image of Your Inner Executioner; eidetic truths to reduce a vastly superior force to phenomenological surrender based on a proposition that at some primitive, ontological level, your side does have hordes of warriors that can't actually be seen yet.  You learn slowly over time, and suffer only eight major dislocations for wrong answers.</para><para>But the constant drilling awakens both your body and your mind, and your attention wanders from your training to the Regent's daughter, Mythanda, whose beauty has captured your heart and inspired Senecalius's epithet: "Best frontal assaults since the Peloponnesian War."  She passes by the training field every Tuesday and watches you-you-trade lacerations and logic with the chief of the Militia.  She always leaves with a smile on her face.</para><para>"His philosophies lean toward probing the Regent's daughter."</para><para>"Very true," comes the reply.  "It'd be a pity if someone were to thrust a bit of chilly reality upon the passion of his musings, wouldn't it?"</para><para>"Indeed.  Now, was that metaphor mixed, or just bad?"</para><para>You, of course, don't hear this.</para><para>Upon passing your final exam in Stealth Epistemology, Senecalius declares you to be "about as smart as one could hope for a soldier."  Congratulations.  To honor this occasion, a celebratory banquet is held at the Regent's palace for all top graduates and their respective Mentors.  As Senecalius's only student, you qualify as his best.  When you enter the banquet hall, you discover, much to your delight, that the Regent and his family are attending the gala, and that your seat is directly next to Mythanda's.  As you pull your seat from the table, she looks up at you expectantly.  You feel compelled to say something. What do you say?</para>|Section D¿Something humorous.  You'll charm the stockings off her.¿Section E¿Something heroic.  Your swaggering bravery will make her swoon.¿Section F¿Something philosophical.  You'll get her attention, at any rate.
Section B|<para>You choose to follow the path of Philosophy.  Three long years of apprenticeship pass.</para><para>You attend the Conglomerate Academy of Wisdom and are put under the scrupulous guidance of the famed despot philosopher Beffles, the Regent's Prime Counsel.  As you endure his rigorous course of training, he teaches you that, above all, the essence of philosophy lies within comedy.  You become immersed in your art.  The slapstick of Laurel and Heidegger, the verbal play of Abailard and Costello, the satire of Sartre all slam against your sense of self-regard as solidly as lemon meringue pie slams against your face which, as part of the training process, happens regularly.</para><para>Amid your exercises, you note that the Regent's daughter, Mythanda, has seen fit to vicariously expand her mind by watching your drills in Logical Positivism and fruitcake juggling.  You, as a result, fall hopelessly in love, for Beauty is Truth ... and who wouldn't be hopelessly attracted to Truth, especially when it is presented in such well-proportioned and curvacious a form?  From the mirth that issues from her as she watches, you deduce that she more than adequately understands the connection between philosophy and comedy.</para><para>"I see that Truth has picked up another ogler."</para><para>"Indeed," comes the reply.  "How very fitting that he will soon discover that Truth is a dish best served cold."</para><para>Pause.  "Thought that was revenge."</para><para>"Don't be pettish."</para><para>You, of course, don't hear this.</para><para>After besting Beffles in Baconian Methodology and Banana Peels at twelve paces, you complete your philosophical training and are immediately accepted as an entry-level employee at the Regent's stables.  Congratulations.  A commencement banquet is held at the Regent's palace to honor all top graduates and their Mentors.  Much to your elation, you find that your seat is adjacent to Mythanda's.  You reach for your chair.  She looks up at you curiously.  You feel compelled to say something.</para><para></para><para>What do you say?</para>|Section D¿Something humorous.  For Humor is a Truth fit to express the merits of Beauty. ¿Section E¿Something gallant.  If the essence of Truth lies in Courage, then it, too, must be suitable for Beauty.¿Section F¿Something philosophical.  Unadulterated Truth is all you need.  Let's hope she thinks so, too.
Section C|<para>You choose to follow the path of Comedy.  Three long years of apprenticeship pass.</para><para>Under the scrutinizing (and, indeed, only) eye of Chief Jester Reginald Dorwin, you delve into the true power of comic presentation.  You learn the value of thrust and counter-thrust, the ironic parry, the metaphoric dodge, the sarcastic double-arc (with added emphasis) and, above all, the intrinsic worth of a good pair of running shoes.  During your training tenure, you are admitted for abdominal surgery only twice for bad puns.</para><para>But, as is normal under the hormonal pressures of youth, your mind wanders from your training to Mythanda, the Regent's preeminently buxomed daughter, who has captured your heart by her consistent stops at the training field to watch you-you-melee with the Chief Jester.  She laughs a lot as she watches.  You must be doing well.</para><para>"He seems to think the world of the Regent's daughter."</para><para>"Very true," comes the reply.  "It'd be a pity if someone were to kidnap her and freeze her alive inside a block of ice, wouldn't it?"</para><para>"Hmmm ..."</para><para>You, of course, don't hear this.</para><para>Upon passing your final exams, and recovering from the ruptured kidney incident, the Chief Jester declares you to be "a complete and total fool," marking your passage into adulthood.  Congratulations.  To honor this occasion, a celebratory banquet is held at the Regent's palace for top graduates and their Mentors.  Much to your flushing pleasure, you discover that the Regent and his family are attending the gala and that your seat is directly next to Mythanda's.  As you pull your seat from the table, she looks up at you with anticipation.  You feel compelled to say something.</para><para></para><para>What do you say?</para>|Section D¿Something humorous.  Why the hell not?  It's what you trained for.¿Section E¿Something gallant.  Women like gallant men, especially ones with scars.¿Section F¿Something philosophical.  Well, anything's worth a shot, isn't it? 
Section D|<para>"So," you start, "there's these three nuns and a llama at the bottom of a cesspool-"</para><para>"Is this a scatological joke?" she interrupts.</para><para>"Uh," you reply with razor-sharp wit.</para><para>"Scatological humor is so debasing," she says.  "If you'd only chosen a form that aspires to Platonic High Comedy ..."  She slowly shakes her head at you.</para><para>You take one more shot at your Comedy of Eros.  "Did I mention that one of the nuns was Descartes?"</para><para>As luck would have it, her reply is drowned out by a band of armed men bursting into the banquet hall.  They have guns.  Not only that: They have guns that work, as evidenced by the way one of the stewards' chests explodes.  They seem intent on reaching the Regent.</para><para>In the ensuing chaos, you have a few brief seconds in which to act.</para><para></para><para>What do you do?</para>|Section G¿Protect yourself.  You want to impress Mythanda-which will be pretty hard if you're dead. ¿Section H¿Protect the Regent.  Maybe that'll impress Mythanda.  Besides, the Regent's the one who pays you.¿Section I¿Protect Mythanda.  If she's dead, there's no reason to impress anyone.
Section E|<para>"So," you say with a deliberate swagger, "I bet you've never seen a scar like this."  You untuck your shirt and point proudly to puckered scabs on your lower abdomen.</para><para>She peers, then temples her hands in contemplation.</para><para>"Impressive, isn't it?" you ask.</para><para>She snickers. "It's shaped just like my cat, Snap," she says, "licking his balls."  With that, she begins to laugh outright.  Loudly.  Which wouldn't be so bad, except that she's repeatedly slapping the table in an attempt to stop.  Her commotion attracts the attention of the entire room, including the Regent's.  They all stare at you, at your uplifted shirt, at your exposed stomach and index finger pointing thereto.  Disapproval sits evident on their faces.</para><para>Luckily for you, though, their attention is yanked away by a band of armed men bursting into the banquet hall.  The men seem keen to get the Regent's attention, as they shoot into the chest of one of the stewards standing beside him.</para><para>In the ensuing chaos, you have a few brief seconds in which to act.</para><para></para><para>What do you do?</para>|Section G¿Protect yourself.  The best offense is a good defense, and you're feeling very offense-orientated at this moment.¿Section H¿Protect the Regent.  What better way to earn brownie points with your employer?¿Section I¿Protect Mythanda.  Maybe she'll stop laughing long enough to thank you.
Section F|<para>"So," you start, "I have it on good authority that essence precedes existence."  You furrow your brows to show how pensive a guy you are.  "Especially at dinner time."</para><para>"Oh," she says.  "That's nice."  She drums her fingers a moment before saying, "Did you know you can kill someone in under six minutes by severing their femoral artery?"</para><para>"Oh," you reply.  "That's nice, too."</para><para>"I mean, easily," she insists, impassioned.  "Even with this tiny serrated steak knife right here!"  She holds it up, her eyes glazing over as she considers its toothy edge.</para><para>Luckily, before you can attempt another scintillating rejoinder, a band of armed men burst into the banquet hall, waving firearms.  Although you believed Mythanda's assertion about arterial vulnerability, you see that a shotgun blast to the chest is an equally, even more, effective method of mortal dispatchment, as is demonstrated on one of the stewards.  The assailants appear to want to use the Regent as their next example.</para><para>Chaos ensues.  You only have a few brief seconds to decide how to react.</para><para></para><para>What do you do?</para>|Section G¿Protect yourself.  Although you firmly believe that existence precedes essence, perhaps your existence should rank first.¿Section H¿Protect the Regent.  Duty to leaders realizes Aristotelian abstract.  Or at least a good pay raise.¿Section I¿Protect Mythanda.  If Truth is Beauty and Beauty Truth, protecting both in the form of Mythanda is bound to get you something ..
Section G|<para>"My God!" someone screams.  "It's the Hegelian Cryotherapists of Ogallala!"</para><para>Sometimes, acts of selflessness begin with understanding your duty to yourself.  After all, how can one be selfless if one's self is shot to pieces by guns-guns, for God's sake, instruments of death from before Last War, devices that weren't supposed to exist anymore!</para><para>These are all the things you're thinking as your body instinctively hurls itself under the banquet table.</para><para>There's screaming throughout the room, more gun shots, angry and frightened shouting.  Unfortunately, you don't get to see any of it, since you've wisely decided to save your own hide.  Unfortunate, too, that the culmination of the battle involves, apparently, some heroic struggler being overcome and thrown full force onto the banquet table, causing it to buckle, crack dangerously, and then collapse directly on top of you.  You stagger from the shambles, only to be kneed in the side of the head by someone running to the Regent's aid.  And the battle continues.</para><para>At least, you guess it continues.

What the hell did you think you were doing?"  Ah, now you've got it.  Chief Jester Dorwin.

"You've got the balls to dare scoff at the Laureates of Utterly Busted Bow?"</para><para>"For certain they do, brother grad student," one of the assailants answers for you.  "Let's slay them anon, so that we can, like, wallow in rueful angst for such a bad deed."</para><para>"Forsooth, dude, stay thy hand," the leader of Laureates answers.  "Let's assay our victims first, ‘cause even in time of certain death, the human mind can hit on new wisdom.  Now.  You."  He prods Chief Jester Dorwin with his sword.  "Define, as you may, a poet."</para><para>"Pansy," Dorwin says.  He joins Beffles on the ground.</para><para>The man moves to Senecalius.  "A poet?"</para><para>"Ah," the Commander says, "an individual who composes verse that is characterized by a condensed use of language more vivid and intense than ordinary prose."</para><para>"Textbook.  Trite."  The Commander falls down, clutching his stomach.</para><para>The man now stands in front of you.  "And you?"</para><para>You eye the armed men around you.  They all look exceptionally eager to be angst-ridden at your expense.  Your situation is desperate.  But not hopeless.</para><para>You reach slowly, thoughtfully, down to the ground, grasp a handful of pine needles, and show them to the Laureate.

Regardless, they decide that a change of direction may be in order, lest they repeat the encounter.</para><para></para>|Section O¿Proceed
Section O|<para>A week of your journey passes, and you travel north after a brief false start eastward.  You search in vain for any sign of paths taken by Heideggerian cryotherapists.  Surprisingly, the Mentors' attitude toward you has begun to soften.  You've faithfully prepared all their meals, laid out and repacked their beddings each night and morn, scrubbed their laundry every other day, saved them from a roving band of mad Poet Laureates, all the sorts of things expected of a good apprentice-squire.  This morning you cross to the north side of the Dismal River and survey the periphery of Nebraska National Forest.  The party holds a strategic conference directly in front of a sign reading:</para><para>NEBRASKA NATIONAL FOREST</para><para>300 YARDS TO EXTREME PERIL</para><para>"I am wont to take such advisories literally," declares Senecalius.  "We would be foolhardy to march in blindly."  His fellows agree that the most prudent course of action would be to exercise caution by sending you in first as a scout.  They follow at fifty paces, swords ready.</para><para>The woods are mossy, dank, and deep.  You promise yourself not to be frightened, and do a pretty good job keeping that promise until the hollow, rasping voice demands, "Tell me."  You turn.  The voice's owner is ten feet tall, sports a gnarled talon at the end of each tendril-like arm, and, most curious, is translucent.</para><para>The Mentors come running at the sound of your scream.  Chief Jester Dorwin arrives first, launching into a brilliant mid-air flip, blade extended and knees tucked tight against his chest as he flies at, then through, the creature, crashing to a sprawl on the far side.</para><para>"Tell me," the creature moans.</para><para>You see Dorwin sizing up the creature, looking like he's deciding whether another brilliant launch might be in order.  Beffles clumps forward, indignant.  "Identify yourself, weird beast!"</para><para>"I am Zeitgeist," the creature intones.  "Much of your human race is now extinct, and I starve from the dearth of tales.  Tell me again the stories of mankind."</para><para>Senecalius snorts.  "This is ridiculous.  Of course you are not Zeitgeist.  Zeitgeist is simply a conceptual logism, a mere semiotic designation meant to-"</para><para>The creature sinks one of its talons into Senecalius's chest.  There is no tear, no puncture, it simply passes through.  Then Senecalius begins to glow, a white aura flowing around his body, up the tendril arm of Zeitgeist.  When the flow stops, Senecalius crumples to an indelicate heap on the forest floor, eyes empty, breathing shallow.</para><para>"His soul is bland," the creature laments.  "All logic, theorem, and tactic with little story."  Zeitgeist shifts to face Beffles.  "Tell me."  The despotic philosopher pales.  Dorwin still makes no move.  The creature extends a talon.</para><para>"Wait!" you scream, and then you sputter, "It-was-the-best-of-times-it-was-the-worst-of-times!"</para><para>The creature withdraws his talon from Beffles.  It tilts its head, assessing you as if you were a queer, unexpected creature yourself.  Then it sits on the forest floor.  "Tell me," it says.</para><para>You tell him, shakily at first, then with calmer voice and growing, genuine emotion, a paraphrase of a tale about two cities.  You finish that in half an hour.  Beffles and Dorwin still remain cautious, actionless, so you tell the creature, "Call me Ishmael."  This story you relate with surges of emotion, editorializing with grandiose critique.  "He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff," you start later, and "At a village of La Mancha whose name I do not wish to remember," and "John T. Unger came from a family that had been well known in Hades," and "In the beginning, God created-" and so on.  The creature sits wordless, enraptured.  Just before sundown, you begin the critical tale: "Now that the radiation has pretty much died out, and people have started building new villages far away from any of the old cities, and the east and west coasts have stopped burning, mostly, your father turns from where he's sitting by the campfire burning some Steinbeck for warmth and says, ‘Son, civilization will be starting up again soon.'"</para><para>You tell that tale.  You tell of choices, of a beautiful girl named Mythanda, of kidnapping cryotherapists, of your mission's criticality, of sitting down in Nebraska National Forest to tell stories to a Zeitgeist.</para><para>Then you stop.  You wait.</para><para>The creature nods once, serenely.  "I realize, young man, that this trick owes homage to the Arabian Nights."</para><para>"I knew you'd catch that," you say.  "I figured you'd respect it."</para><para>"I do."  It chuckles, resonant and sad.  "But mostly, I'd like to know what happens next."  The creature again thrusts a talon into Senecalius's chest.  The air around the comatose Commander shimmers.  "I'll give back your minor character's soul.  You may need him later in the plot."</para><para>Beffles finally moves, coaxing Senecalius to his feet.  Dorwin edges a wary perimeter around the beast, rejoining your party.  You stand and back away slowly.</para><para>"Return some day, young man," Zeitgeist says.  "I'd like to know how this story ends."</para><para>"I will," you say, meaning it.</para>|Section P¿Proceed
Section P|<para>Your search for the Heisenbergian cryotherapists and for Mythanda is now reaching the close of its second week, and desperation to find any clue whatsoever has sent the party east, north, and now, finally, in a committed southerly direction.  In the few hundred square miles you've covered, you've discovered an intriguing truth about Nebraska: It's really flat.  In other circumstances, that observation would be pedestrian.  But you can't help thinking that if there were any clue of Mythanda's whereabouts, it couldn't remain hidden long in this stretch of doldrum.</para><para>"We're doing something wrong," you mutter as you stare into the campfire.  The party is well south into Lincoln County, camped a few yards from the banks of Red Willow.</para><para>Dorwin grunts once at your comment, noncommittal, but Senecalius murmurs accord.  "Agreed, Asswipe.  This futile, proctalgiac meandering befogs our mission's exigency."</para><para>"And we ain't gettin' nowhere, fast," Dorwin adds.</para><para>"I don't think we're even close," says Beffles.</para><para>"That was way too close this time," he complains to his colleague.  "Those dolts have almost caught up to us or stumbled across our campsites five times already!"</para><para>"I can't figure it out," the colleague says.  "It's like they know every detail of our escape route."</para><para>"They'll continue to fall short in their attempts to capture us," their leader, the man called Icer, hisses.  "One of them is, after all, on our side."</para><para>The colleagues whistle low.  "Cold, very cold," they say, impressed.</para><para>"For God's sake," you sputter, "I don't even know what a cryotherapist is."</para><para>"They're jerks," Beffles snaps.  "A crazy little cult of post-Last-War pseudo-scientist revolutionaries."</para><para>"They espouse a nearly fanatical belief," says Senecalius, "that all ailments, physical, spiritual, or sociological, can be healed through the application of diminished temperature."</para><para>"Better livin' through frigidity," grunts Dorwin.</para><para>You're confused.  "So why are they called Heisenbergian cryotherapists?  What's Heisenbergian about that?"</para><para>"No, no, they're called Hegelian cryotherapists," says Beffles.  "They see themselves as the antithesis of plebeian belief in the benefits of warmth.  They feel they have to smash against the accepted thesis until a new order rises."</para><para>Dorwin shakes his head with vehemence.  "Listen, pal, they're called Heideggerian cryotherapists.  They say they're makin' a sorta leap of faith into a freeze-dried belief thing that'll restore civilization.  Unless we stop ‘em, they're gonna leap right onto the Regent's head and take over Conglomerate, the only post-Last-War society showing any stayin' power."</para><para>Senecalius tsk-tsks.  "Our apprentice is right.  It's Heisenberg, based on their admission of their methodology's uncertainty.  They experiment endlessly on unwilling human subjects.  Those who do not manage to improve through Cold Treatment applications-that would be the majority of their kidnapped victims-are deemed anomalies.  ‘The Unpredictable Majority' is what I believe they call their frost-death victims.  ‘Who'd have guessed it would hurt them?' they say.  Uncertainty.  Solid Heisenberg."</para><para>"Okay, okay," you say, still juggling the assertions of your party of Mentors.  "But whether it's Heisenberg, Heidegger, or Hegel, they're always referred to as the ‘cryotherapists of Ogallala,' right?"</para><para>"Indeed/yes/uh-huh," they all agree.</para><para>You tap an anxious foot, weighing how they might react to your next point.  "Since Ogallala, Nebraska is on the Platte River to the west of Conglomerate Capitol, why the hell aren't we going in that direction?"</para><para>Another two logs burn before anyone responds.  "I believe we shall travel west to Ogallala with first light," Senecalius avers before all of you bed for the night.</para><para>The fire is doused and you lie down.  The night is an endless pitch of featureless landscape, but deeply bright above with stars.  Before you fall asleep, Prime Counsel Beffles crawls over to your bed mat.  "And I think," he whispers, "that we've seriously underestimated the abilities of apprentice Steffan McFessel."</para><para>You can't decide whether that assertion elates you or gives you reason to worry.  You dream of Mythanda all night.  You dream of saving her from the clutches of evil usurpers, of winning her heart, and of finding true romance at the end of this unwelcome quest.</para>|Section Q¿Proceed
Section Q|<para>The trek westward is short, but arduous.  Rain hampers your every step, but you press onward, fueled by conviction that your fruitless wanderings are near an end.  Soon, just east of Ogallala, Nebraska, you come across irrigation trenches and small dumpsites, evidence of a nearby populace.  The dumpsites yield your first clues: discarded syringes, rubber gloves, battered ice cube trays, promotional tracts headlined, "Freedom Thru Freeze at Camp Cryotherapy!"  Not much farther, and you come upon the barbed-wired, fenced-in boundaries of a small settlement.  The Cryotherapist Camp.</para><para>Dorwin points through the scrub.  "They got prisoners.  Those three, by the well.  Look pretty beat up, too."</para><para>"If those buildings are barracks," Senecalius notes, "there may be dozens of others."</para><para>You consider this for a moment.  Whatever you do, you'll have to be careful.  There are lives at stake here.  Mythanda's is one of them.  You have to think big ...</para><para>"You do realize they're right at our front door, don't you?" the colleague asks.</para><para>"They haven't a chance," Icer answers.</para><para>The colleague grunts.  "I hope you're right."</para><para>Icer smiles.  "Destiny is on our side."</para><para>"We surrender!" you yell, arms high.  The Mentors follow suit, standing with you.  The rubber mat in front of the gate reads "Welcome to Camp Cryo" in worn letters.</para><para>"You what?" a voice asks from behind the front gate.</para><para>"We give up, can't take any more!  Do what you will!"</para><para>You hear muttered voices inside, ranging from "New ones usually have to be dragged in," to "God dammit, I answered the gate last time."  The iron-reinforced door creaks open.  You see four men in white lab coats, all carrying shotguns.</para><para>"Uh, hi," says the closest one.  "If you could just follow me to your cells, I-"</para><para>You abruptly yank the welcome mat from the ground and lash at the cryotherapist's head with it.  The corner catches his eye, and with a scream, he loses his grip on his weapon.  You catch it, roll onto your stomach, and fire.  The shot goes wild, missing the three remaining men, but a muffled explosion resounds behind them.  Just as they are about to open fire on your party, a fiery blast bursts from the Camp's interior, blowing the gate off its hinges and onto the gunmen, crushing them.</para><para>No time to waste.  You scramble from your position and dive over the wreckage, your gun now wielded as a club.  But as you scan the courtyard, you see no further opposition.  In fact, the only movement you see is the waving of hands through a barred window in one of the barracks.</para><para>You jog to the barracks and smash the lock with the shotgun's butt.  When you open the door, a torrent of humanity streams out.  They are bruised, malnourished, all shivering.  Some of their extremities are tinged with the blackness of non-circulation.  Others lack fingers and toes.</para><para>"You blew up their cold storage unit," one captive says, awed.  "That's where they experimented on us."</para><para>"I'm looking for a young woman," you say.  "About my age, long blonde hair."</para><para>"The VIP," an older prisoner offers.  "We heard about her when she first came, but she didn't stay with us.  They keep her in the cave."  He points out a cave entrance in the hillside banking the Camp.  You acknowledge with a nod.</para><para>The Mentors help the more enfeebled prisoners out into the warm air.  Beffles looks profoundly disturbed by their condition.  "A lot of these folks are on the brink of death.  Someone's got to stay here and save them."</para><para>"Stay and tend, Prime Counsel," Senecalius says.  "We three shall suffice to deal with their remaining forces."</para><para>Dorwin turns to you.  "Cave fight.  What do you think?"</para><para>"I think," you say, eyeing the quest's final objective, "that destiny is on our side."</para><para></para><para>Now that you know where the cave is, how do you approach it?</para>|Section R¿Burst in heroically.

Take a comedic approach. ¿Section U¿It doesn't matter how, just get there.
Section R|<para>After quick but careful planning, you decide attack the cave in a frontal assault, even after you learn that the cave serves as the cryotherapist's main weapons hold.  But you don't care.  Heros shirk fear in the face of adversity.  Your sword will do fine.  Senecalius and Dorwin are less enthusiastic about the strategy, but agree to go along with you if they get to hold position a safe distance behind you.</para><para>You reach the cave entrance with surprisingly little resistance.  A few random gunshots seem aimed in your direction, but none comes close to hitting.  A trap perhaps?  The False-Sense-of-Security Ruse?  You wonder as you follow the cave's descending passageway.</para><para>You see Mythanda.</para><para>Without hesitation, you rush in to stand before your true love.  The Mentors swear at your impetuousness, but they join you, swords ready.</para><para>All you can do is stare at the Regent's daughter.</para><para>She is encased in what looks to be a block of ice, which you verify by touching the cold, wet surface.

"You are a fool."  With that, you hear telltale shuffling beyond the torch-lit dimness, sounds of weapons scraping against rock walls, low, sadistic chuckles.</para><para>You squint into darkness for unseen opponents but speak to the man in black.  "We've bested a whole camp of your lackeys.  What makes you think this remnant can stop us?"</para><para>The man in black casually yanks a stray thread from his leather glove.  "Because, boy, you underestimate the situation you and your ... loyal friends are in."</para><para>"And what, pray tell, do you mean by that?" Senecalius challenges.  "Mister ...?"</para><para>"Icer," the man says calmly.  "Let's just say you're in the dark about a few interesting business arrangements."</para><para>"He's right," you hear from the cave mouth.  Amid the murmurs of the cryotherapists, Beffles steps inside, his sword drawn.  "There's a traitor in our own group."</para><para>"And," Icer adds, "he's led you right here to this cave, just as planned."</para><para>After quick consideration, you conclude that it's not you.

Section S|<para>After a short discussion with Chief Jester Dorwin and Commander Senecalius, you decide to approach the cave from the back to search for a subtler means of entry.  Kierkegaard may have had some odd ideas in his time, but inherent human concern for physical existence wasn't one of them.</para><para>You suffer only a few scrapes and scratches as you climb uphill through scrub and, after a series of short sprints, maneuver cautiously to the back.  There, you spy a fissure in the rock, just large enough to pass through sideways.  This strategic entrance is unguarded.</para><para>Mentor Dorwin volunteers to scout inside and signal if everything is clear.  Roughly a minute passes before his arm appears through the fissure to wave you inside.  You follow.</para><para>After squeezing your way in, three things catch your eye: You see Mythanda, more beautiful than when you last saw her, encased in what looks to be a block of ice.

"I thought that's why we lured them here."</para><para>"In due course," Icer answers.  "We must have ample time to gloat first."</para><para>"Gloat?  About how you've slaughtered innocents?" you shoot back.  "About how you kidnap people's daughters and ... experiment or whatever on them?"</para><para>"Oh, nothing so gauche," Icer says.  "I was thinking more of how we've been able to manipulate your party without so much as lifting a finger."  He shrugs.  "Anyone can slaughter innocents, but imposing your will on others while giving them the illusion of free choice is an entirely different matter."</para><para>"He's right," you hear a familiar voice say.  The cryotherapists shuffle uneasily as Beffles steps into the torch-lit area, sword drawn.</para><para>"Ah, the last of the happy party," Icer coos.</para><para>"There's a traitor in our own group," the Prime Counsel says darkly.  "And I happen to know who he is."</para><para>After quick consideration, you firmly conclude that it's not you.  But that leaves you with three choices.</para><para></para><para>Who is the traitor?</para>|Section V¿Beffles.  You don't really believe that he stayed at the camp just because he's a nice person, do you, Asswipe?¿Section W¿Senecalius.  He's the only one who hasn't done anything suspicious, and is therefore a natural suspect.¿Section X¿Dorwin.  He waved you into this deathtrap.  A predictable setup, but it works.
Section T|<para>Since you aren't sure that the blast that blew off the concentration camp's gates has destroyed the cryotherapists' weapon depot, and since the blast itself has pretty much fucked your chances for effecting a stealthy approach, you, Senecalius, and Dorwin decide that neither heroic frontal assault nor philosophical subtlety will best win you entrance to the cave.  That's why you casually saunter up to the opening and call down, "Hello!  Meter Reader!"</para><para>It is several minutes before the arrival of an uncertain response from deep within the cave: "Uh, what?"</para><para>"Meter Reader!  Keith County Gas and Electric."</para><para>Silence.  Then a curt, "Sorry.  We're in the shower."</para><para>"All of you?  Oh, come on, now!  I've gotta check your usage for the last quarter."</para><para>Brief, hushed discussion precedes the next response.  "Look, we don't really use all that much heat here."</para><para>You harumph loudly enough for them to hear  "My records show you're running gas-powered refrigerators.  We've had to bill you on estimates for over a decade now.  If I don't get an actual reading, I'm gonna lose my job."</para><para>Senecalius and Dorwin shuffle behind you, impatient to strike.  More discussion below, then: "Truth is, it's not a good time for us.  We're in the middle of a hostile assault right now.  Could you come back Tuesday, maybe two-ish?"</para><para>You begin to clomp downward into the cave-loudly, obviously, sounding not in the least like a person who's sneaking up.  "It'll only take me a few seconds.  Just a quick read off the dial, a quick scribble in my record log, and then I'm out of your hair for-"</para><para>You stop.  The passage has led to a vast, dimly lit cavern.  At the cavern's center, encased in a transparent crystal block, is the naked body of Mythanda, unmoving, unbreathing.  Her eyes are wide open, and she looks as if she has been frozen in the midst of taking a step-one leg lifted and forward, her right hand at waist level, reaching out to you, palm upward, her lips slightly parted as if about to utter the word "I ..." like "I need help" or "I'm trapped in here" or "I love you, Steffan McFessel."</para><para>"In there," a voice hisses, "she's more alluring than you've ever known her to be."  You turn to find yourself facing a tall, thin man garbed entirely in black, pointing a sleek handgun at you and the Mentors.  Movement in the shadows indicates he has others backing him up.</para><para>"What the hell have you done to her?" you demand.</para><para>"Immortalized her beauty.  And crushed her father's power."  The whiteness of his sudden grin startles you.</para><para>"His name is Icer," explains a voice from the passageway behind you and Mentors.  Beffles steps into the cavern.  "And this expedition was doomed from the onset.  One of our own party is in league with him."</para><para></para><para>This is no longer funny.  Who is the traitor?</para>|Section V¿Beffles.  He's a philosopher, a comedian, despotic, and he's short.  Perfect villain material.¿Section W¿Senecalius.  Would you trust anyone with a fake, pretentious classical name? ¿Section X¿Dorwin.

And no more time wasted trying to decide how to grab hold of true love, how to rescue the maiden in distress and live happily-ever-et cetera.  You walk-not charge, not sneak, not slapstick saunter-to the cave's entrance and descend a passageway into the darkness.

"You're part of this maniac's band of cryotherapists?"</para><para>Your father beams.  He's become a total nutcase.</para><para>"Run along now," the man in black prods your father.  "I've left a nice Sno-Cone waiting for you at the camp."  Your father rushes past you like a hyperactive child.</para><para>"You bastard," you growl at the man called Icer.</para><para>"What's the matter?" he asks with condescension.  "Don't like how the story's going?  Maybe forgot that most western literature invokes a father-son conflict?"</para><para>You glance at Mythanda's frozen form, and your hand grips tighter on the hilt of your sword.  "Yes, it is just a story, isn't it?  And you and your cryotherapists are on the verge of becoming a pathetic footnote to the whole history."</para><para>"Uh, oh," Icer remarks calmly.  "A sudden plot twist.  You're about to be killed dead."  Where the cavern's light fades to unseen walls, there is movement.  But Icer isn't looking that way.  He's staring beyond you, to the way you entered.  "You see," Icer gloats, "I've managed your every movement until now.  Through espionage."</para><para>You turn to see Beffles in the passageway behind Dorwin and Senecalius.  "He's right," Beffles confirms.  "Our party has a traitor.</para><para></para><para>Act now.

"You stupid little shit."</para><para>Apologies and absolution will have to come later.  You spin on heel and zero your swordpoint at Icer.  "Free the girl," you order.  "Now."  But Icer keeps regarding you as more curiosity than threat.  It's unsettling.</para><para>With the unpredictable impulsiveness you've come to expect from him, Dorwin leaps fully at Icer.  Both men's weapons are knocked free.  You see concern flicker across Icer's face for the first time.  Their struggle slows to the deadlock of mutual wrestling holds, and you move to shift the advantage.  You jump head-on into the two of them.</para><para>Icer twists, staggers, and releases.  Dorwin takes most of your impact, skidding backward across the floor, slamming full force into the base of the ice block imprisoning Mythanda, and staring helplessly as the block shifts, tips, and falls on him.  The impact deafens like a thousand simultaneously shattered mirrors.  When the ice stops skittering across the cave floor, you manage to make out the bloody pulp that was Dorwin.  The bits of sharded flesh that were Mythanda are unrecognizable.</para><para>"The boy has a habit of saving my life unwillingly."  Icer isn't even breathing hard.  "Shall we enlist him?"</para><para>"I think not," Senecalius says.  "Perhaps you've not seen what happens to his allies?"</para><para>Icer nods gravely.  "Then I believe it's time for us to storm the Regent's palace, my Lord Senecalius."  He waves a hand, and the cryotherapist force moves quietly to the cavern's exit.  "With the Jester and the Prime Counsel out of the way, you'll pull off the easiest coup in history."</para><para>"And you shall be handsomely rewarded for your assistance," Senecalius vows.</para><para>"I know," Icer hisses.</para><para>No one gives you a second look.  No one stops to consider you.  To kill you.  Which is unfortunate.  Never more than at this moment have you so wanted to be dead.</para>|Section Y¿Proceed
Section W|<para>There's a sudden swarm of movement as Icer's cryotherapists rush from all sides.  In what is perhaps the most awkward, clumsy, yet still awesomely effective move of your apprenticeship career, you grab the blade of traitor Senecalius's drawn sword, ignore the pain and blood of your own hand, and shove the blade edge-on, full-force into Senecalius's face.  He blinks twice from the recessed sockets of his now-split cranium and drops to the floor.</para><para>A pinprick sensation in your neck, a harsh whisper in your ear, the voice of Court Jester Dorwin.  "Bad guess."</para><para>The cryotherapist crowd has enveloped the squirming, screaming Prime Counsel Beffles.  The philosopher is begging for help.  He's calling out Senecalius's name.  He didn't see you take out the Mentor, and he goes to his death clinging to the hope of Senecalius's imminent rescue attempt.</para><para>"Far easier than I'd imagined, Mr. Chief Jester."</para><para>Dorwin shoves you to the floor.  "Sure as hell was.  Maybe I shouldn't be payin' you so much."</para><para>Icer pretends surprise.  "Now, now, friend Dorwin.  Wasn't I the one who suggested you execute your coup through stealth rather than outright assault?  How well would you have fared if Regent Nicholas hadn't sent out the majority of his forces on fruitless searches for his darling daughter?  That strategy alone earns my full fee."</para><para>"Well, yeah," Dorwin admits.</para><para>They're ignoring you.  Their mistake.  You leap to your feet, sword still in hand.  "You've manipulated me long enough.  The girl.  Free her and hand her over."</para><para>Icer rolls his eyes, shakes his head.  "What the hell is this kid ranting about?"</para><para>Dorwin chuckles.  "Ah, don't worry about him.  He's got a hero complex workin'.  Thinks he's in love with the girl."</para><para>It bothers you that neither of them seems worried about your sword.  "You've toyed with me for too long.  If you plan to go on living, you'll let her go."</para><para>Dorwin cuffs the back of your head, not even worried about your waving sword.  "You boob!  What the hell goes on in that puny brain of yours?  None of this has anything to do with you!  You're here by accident.  By coincidence."</para><para>Icer waves a hand to calm the Chief Jester's rage.  "Dorwin, Dorwin, you of all people should understand the fantasies of a young heart aspiring to adventure.  We march on Nicholas tomorrow, so we're done with the girl.  If he wants her, let him have her."</para><para>Dorwin cocks his head.  "Really?"</para><para>"Certainly."  Icer raises his gun.  "So tell me, boy, what attracts you to her?  Her mind?"  A single, sharp crack comes from Icer's gun.  It seems as if the ice block holding Mythanda just flecks a bit, but when the steam clears you see a small, bloodless hole in her forehead.  "Perhaps you love her for her heart?"  Another crack, and a similar hole appears on her left breast.  "Wait," Icer croons.  "Now I know what it is."  The third hole is dead center pelvis.  "There you go.  All yours."</para><para>The sword slips from your limp hand.  You sink to the floor, first to knees, then to elbows, then you cry.</para><para>"Pathetic," you hear Dorwin say.  Then you hear dozens of feet marching up the passageway, out of the cave.  Then you hear nothing.</para><para></para>|Section Y¿Proceed
Section X|<para>An outright fight with Dorwin would be suicide.  So you rush to the Chief Jester's side, stand shoulder-to-shoulder with him, and, your sword out toward the others, ask, "Which one of them do you think it is?"</para><para>The lying traitor shams careful consideration of your question.  He never expects the quick thrust that enters his throat, exits the base of his skull.  He falls to the floor, and you yank your sword from his corpse.</para><para>"Now that's weird," Beffles says.  "Because all this time I've been pretty sure that I'm the traitor."</para><para>"My God!" Senecalius bellows.  He makes a break for the exit, and Beffles steps aside to allow him passage, offering a courtly bow and an extended hand to urge him along.</para><para>"Run!" the Prime Counsel invites.  "But there's nowhere to go.  Our forces have already taken Capitol.  Nicholas has every main unit out in the wilderness looking for the girl.  It was hardly a fight at all to usurp the Conglomerate."</para><para>Senecalius hesitates, but then bolts up the passageway, ignoring your pleas that he stay with you and fight it out.  You hear a muffled explosion from just beyond the mouth of the cave.  Beffles, studying his fingernails, announces, "Oh, by the way, Icer.  I dug out a couple of your spare land mines.  I think Senecalius found where I left them."</para><para>You dive, roll off your shoulder, and land on your feet in a protective stance in front of Mythanda's ice prison.  "What you didn't count on," you say menacingly, "is me."</para><para>The cryotherapists, Icer, and Beffles look at you for a moment.  Then they go about their business, gathering gear, conversing excitedly amongst themselves.</para><para>"Hey!" you yell.  "Where do you think you're going?"</para><para>"Give it a rest, kid," Beffles says.  "Fight's over."</para><para>Your sword wavers.  "But, Mythanda.  You've got to let her out.  Revive her.  You've got to."</para><para>Beffles guffaws at the suggestion.  "Revive her?  What are you, dim?  These twits don't know the first thing about cryogenics.  Most of them are whacko, kid!"</para><para>Icer waves a finger.  "Not true.  We're close.  Just a little more time, that's all we need.  And a research grant from your new government.  We're so close."</para><para>"Yeah, yeah," Beffles dismisses the assertion.  "But the girl's gone, McFessel.  Has been since day one.  We just needed to buy time to get Nicholas's forces as far from Capitol as possible."</para><para>You slump against the cold of what you'd assumed was Mythanda's prison, what you now know is her grave.  "Then kill me, too.  Please.  Kill me."</para><para>"Sorry, kid, no time.  Got a government to claim.  And you people!" Beffles yells to the exiting horde of cryotherapists.  "Watch your step out there!  Couple more live mines, you know!"</para><para>Icer and Beffles are the last to leave.  "Kill me!" you scream at their departing backs.  "Kill me, kill me!"</para><para>"The kid has a hero complex," the waning echo of Beffles's voice explains to Icer.  "He really thought he was the focal point of some glorious adventure quest ..."</para><para>The voice fades away.  You keep leaning against the ice block, alive.  Alone.</para>|Section Y¿Proceed
